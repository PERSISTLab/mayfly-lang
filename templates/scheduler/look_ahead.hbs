	// Keep multiple arrays, one column for each task graph
	// Keep a bit that says there is progress in a graph (or just a byte that has the index of the last task)
	// Keep the arrays in priority order, so check high priority first, then go towards source
	// Also check the data expiration, if expired then decrement the task pointer in the task
